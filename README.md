# Binary-Search-Tree
Binary Search Tree that uses different methods of traversal in Java

This project was created in my CS 241 (Data Structures and Algorithms II) class as a class assignment. The purpose of the assignment was to learn about different methods of traversal when it comes to binary trees.
